            <p class="aligned-paragraph">BEMAT which stands for bio ecological monitoring and assessment team.
                We are group of environmental researchers’ scientist  who are based in Nairobi, Kenya who 
                 basically deals with study of animals and their surroundings. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;</p>
            <p class="aligned-paragraph">Our company started in 2020 by graduates from different universities in Kenya who initially had just volunteered
                  to work at the museum. Currently, we are composed of 7 employees.</p>&nbsp; 
            <p class="aligned-paragraph"> We deal with research on different animals where we collect the specimen from areas like swamps and forests 
                   in different counties then it is taken to the museum laboratory for operation or preservation for future study.
                    After thorough analysis on the specimens, a document is written involving all the procedures conducted to help 
                    know how to improve animals living conditions based on their environmental surrounding. </p>&nbsp;
            <p class="aligned-paragraph">Different counties in Kenya contain different species of animals, therefore, it makes us have to visit all
                     these areas to carry out studies for weeks which partly some are sponsored while others are just individual research.	</p>
